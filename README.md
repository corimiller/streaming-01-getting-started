## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.10 or higher
1. VS Code
1. VS Code Extension: Python
1. Git (configured)

Remember:

## Verify Installations / Update Default Python

Already had most of this installed. 
```

## Execute Utility Script (Diagnostics)

With your repo folder open in VS Code:

1. Click util_about.py.
1. If VS Code prompts, install the recommended Python extension.
1. Check the Python Interpreter: On the bottom-left status bar, you might see a version of Python indicated (e.g., Python 3.10.x).
1. If not, click on the bottom status bar where it should show the Python version or might say "Select Python Interpreter".
1. From the dropdown, choose your default Python version.
1. In VS Code, open a terminal window (View / Terminal).
1. If macOS/Linux, change `python` to `python3` below.

```shell
python util_about.py
```
